This is more of a maintenance TODO more than a feature TODO

* Class header comments
* Check header guards
* Make sure all classes that should be non-copyable are
* Add license text
* Add an exception for filesystem parsing
* Some tests aren't cleaning up well/being flaky
** In particular, make sure destructors are called in the right order
* Move dattosrv out of dattocli and into a test directory
* Speed up tracer flushing as this seems to be the slowest part at the end of a backup
