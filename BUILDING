This file contains build information I'll probably forget if I don't record it

glog:
    don't build it as root, fakeroot may get mad
    install libunwind for stacktraces
    build glog after installing libunwind
    make deb will build the two .debs, do this for easy removal

libraries:
    glog
    devmapper
    probably some fs stuff
    protobuf
