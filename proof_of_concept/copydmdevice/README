Libraries:
    You will need libdevmapper and libext2fs to run
    You will need the development versions of the above to build

Keep in mind before running (a.k.a. things to be fixed in later versions):
    If you don't have the kernel modules you need loaded, your entire computer
        will hang until you hard reboot it.
